## Ethical Considerations

## 🎯 Quick Start

NextAI is designed with ethics in mind:

### Expected Training Metrics

- **Privacy**: No personal data is stored or logged

- **Transparency**: Open-source model and training process### Basic Usage

- **Safety**: Filtered training data to avoid harmful content

- **Responsibility**: Mental health responses include disclaimers and professional help recommendationsBased on 1M lines of data with GPT-2 Medium:

- **Fairness**: Trained to provide unbiased guidance across demographics

```python

## Limitations

- **Initial Loss**: ~3.5-4.0import nextai

- NextAI is an AI assistant and should not replace professional counseling or medical advice

- Responses may occasionally contain inaccuracies; always verify critical information- **Final Loss**: ~1.2-1.8 (after convergence)

- The model is trained primarily on Indian education system data

- Best suited for guidance and information, not for critical decision-making- **Training Time**: 8-12 hours on single V100 GPU# Load a pre-trained model



## License- **GPU Memory**: ~10-12GB requiredmodel = nextai.models.load('resnet50', pretrained=True)
